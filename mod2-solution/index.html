        <p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Let's get wild today. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.</p>

        <p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Trees grow however makes them happy. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. With practice comes confidence.</p>

        <p>The least little bit can do so much. We'll play with clouds today. There are no limits in this world. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. I like to beat the brush. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>
