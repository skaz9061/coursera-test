                    And just raise cain. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Anything you want to do you can do here.

                    Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.

                    But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. See there, told you that would be easy. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>

                    Fluff that up. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

                    Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.

                    A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. We'll have a super time. Let that brush dance around there and play.

                    Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. This painting comes right out of your heart. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.</p>

                    I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.

                    Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. I like to beat the brush. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.

                    Let's build some happy little clouds up here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. See there, told you that would be easy. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
